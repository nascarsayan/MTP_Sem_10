The components of the database are as shown in the diagram below.

The experiment data was collected from 30 healthy volunteers, comprising 13 male and 17 female between 19 to 40 years old. EEG Signals were recorded from 32 active electrodes on 10-20 international system using a Biosemi Active II system. A total of 546 emotion elicitation experiments were conducted. The 32 EEG channels of interest along with their indices are shown below.

Each Biosemi Data Format (BDF) file contains 47 channels out of which channels 1 - 32 are EEG signals, channels 33 - 46 are signals from other physiological activities, and channel 47 is the Status channel. The stimuli were videos included in the Hollywood Human Action dataset \cite{holly}. 20 videos were used in the experiment. Each subject watched all the 20 videos in a single run. So, in order to reduce the influence(bias) from watching the previous videos, the subject was shown neutral videos in between each stimulus video. Hence, in each BDF file, there is around 15 seconds of physiological readings of the subject both at the start and at the end of the emotion elicitation experiment. The exact point of time when the stimuli started and ended was marked in the Status channel, i.e., channel 47. The flow of the experiment with time is shown below.
